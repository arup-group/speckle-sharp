## Introduction

## Documentation


## Developing & Debugging

### Requirements

- Microstation versions: 
- A Speckle Server running (more on this below)
- Speckle Manager (more on this below)

## Getting Started

The following instructions are for getting started debugging and contributing to this connector.

#### Dependencies

### Debugging

After setting up dependencies, server and accounts you're good to go - almost there! After the first build, make sure to:

- Open the corresponding connector config folder (e.g., `C:\ProgramData\Bentley\MicroStation CONNECT Edition\Configuration\Organization`)
- Copy the `SpeckleMicroStation2.cfg` located in the Connector folder to the Bentley confic folder

You can now start a Visual Studio's debug session for MicroStation, OpenRoad, or OpenRail. This will launch the corresponding application for you, and the Speckle toolbar should be loaded!
